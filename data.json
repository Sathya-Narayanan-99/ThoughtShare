I got involved early on. People either love me or hate me for this somewhat crazy technological choice. They sometimes write misinformed articles about my belief in the future of money, while simultaneously closing their mind to new ideas. They think I care about Bitcoin opinions. I don&rsquo;t. My only goal in life is to make people think. Getting people to agree with my point of view is the stuff of mind control. I can&rsquo;t brainwash you. Sorry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People <a class=\"ci ip\" href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2021/02/lummis-bitcoin-laser-eyes.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">think</a> the price of each coin hitting $100,000 USD is the end game. While the rise in value is nice for us early adopters of Bitcoin, it completely misses the point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bitcoin could go back down to <a class=\"ci ip\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/ubs-wealth-warns-clients-crypto-prices-can-actually-go-to-zero\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">$100</a>. I don&rsquo;t think it will. But if Bitcoin does do something crazy in terms of price then so be it. I feel like Bitcoin is a radical shift in thinking that is infecting the planet faster than any pandemic. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t an investment. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t a get-rich-quick scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bitcoin is a different way of thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Bitcoin does keep accelerating in adoption then the foundation of society is going to change. Society is built on centralization. Society is set up by governments. Society is made up of races limited by borders. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t have borders. There is no Bitcoin office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t complain to Bitcoin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t be shut down by the billionaire owner of Bitcoin. The creator of Bitcoin is a mystery &mdash; it could be Wonder Woman for all we know. You&rsquo;re free to look into Bitcoin or not. You&rsquo;re free to buy Bitcoin. You&rsquo;re free to transact in Bitcoin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People get easily caught in the hype cycle of Bitcoin, or the anger in the fact they didn&rsquo;t buy Bitcoin, and so they feel like they must throw stones at anybody who did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the point that is missed: Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t care. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about your emotions. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t care if you got rich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bitcoin is a quiet protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s the idea that inequality is bad. It&rsquo;s the <a class=\"ci ip\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/williammeehan/2020/10/21/can-the-federal-reserve-print-money-forever-or-how-continuing-to-print-money-to-support-deficit-spending-may-end-badly-with-chinas-help/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">idea</a> that money created out of thin air and handed to a small few to inflate the stock market is fundamentally wrong. It&rsquo;s the idea homes shouldn&rsquo;t cost a lifetime worth of hours stuck in a cubicle. It&rsquo;s the idea you should be able to send money anywhere in the world within a few minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, like the internet, we will all be using Bitcoin. Bitcoin is monetary information system sitting on an esoteric technology platform called blockchain. Blockchain will eventually be the honesty you rely on to move a widget from A to B in either the physical world or the virtual world.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Bitcoin is the democratization and fragmentation of everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea is <a class=\"ci ip\" href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?lang=en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">trending</a> on Twitter almost every day. It&rsquo;s taking over traditional news. People with an audience are talking about it. Social media is pushing content that talks about it. Almost every online community has at least one ongoing conversation currently talking about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bitcoin was always inevitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A financial system that <a class=\"ci ip\" href=\"https://medium.com/the-ascent/money-is-going-to-fundamentally-alter-in-the-next-2-years-inclusion-access-equality-are-coming-7ae93e67ed80\" rel=\"noopener\">excludes</a> people was never going to be viable long-term. People are a wake-up to the monetary circus we live in. People want change and so they are buying into the idea of Bitcoin.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Bitcoin may not be the end product.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Pets dot com used to be a classic website as a punk kid. They got wiped out even though they were one of the first internet companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many other early tech giants got wiped out, too.<br />\r\nThe same could happen to Bitcoin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bitcoin is the start of the evolution of the internet. It may not be the end state. Although I think there is unlikely to be a challenger to Bitcoin and its one purpose of storing anybody&rsquo;s built-up value (digital gold). A Bitcoin competitor would likely be silenced before it got the chance to get up and dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bitcoin is an accident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It snuck in through the back door and governments didn&rsquo;t pay any attention to it. In 2017 there was a perfect opportunity to <a class=\"ci ip\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/china-ban-bitcoin-exchanges-2017-9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ban Bitcoin</a>. It didn&rsquo;t happen. Now that Bitcoin is so big, and <a class=\"ci ip\" href=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/7-public-companies-with-exposure-to-bitcoin-154201525.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">public companies</a> like Tesla (with powerful CEOs) own it, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to ban it without creating global protests. The internet would rise up if anybody messed with Bitcoin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the optimist&rsquo;s point of view. Still, Bitcoin could become a horse and cart, too. A better technology could come along. Bitcoin could be the 56K modem of the first iteration of the internet. <a class=\"ci ip\" href=\"https://medium.com/the-ascent/ethereum-is-the-next-big-mover-after-bitcoin-804f6d2606b7\" rel=\"noopener\">Ethereum</a> could become the high-speed broadband competitor that swallows Bitcoin. I don&rsquo;t think so, as both have their place in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bitcoin works as it is because it&rsquo;s so stupidly simple. It has one use. Its speed is irrelevant. Anybody can understand what Bitcoin is even if they have never turned on a computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bitcoin is where you store your time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The Alternatives Are Grandfather Clocks</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>You can ignore Bitcoin. You can pretend it&rsquo;s evil. Then you&rsquo;re left with the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Stocks &mdash; record highs with a strong chance of a correction.</li>\r\n\t<li>Gold &mdash; a heavy, expensive, under-performing fax machine.</li>\r\n\t<li>Real estate &mdash; a good option if you can stomach the enormous upfront cost and the global property bubble.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bonds &mdash; paying to own debt that pays you next to nothing in interest.</li>\r\n\t<li>Derivatives &mdash; bet on the price of an asset without owning it. Welcome to the global casino that can keep going when sport stops due to a pandemic.</li>\r\n\t<li>Savings account &mdash; throw your money on the sidewalk and step on it two hundred times. It pays more in entertainment value than an old bank.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The options to store value are pretty terrible for the foreseeable future. Hence the reason Bitcoin, and to a lesser extent, Ethereum, have become interesting. You can see why the idea of Bitcoin is gaining traction. It&rsquo;s not that $100,000 per Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t cool. It&rsquo;s that existing financial products are broken.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Without Bitcoin, You Get Taxed in the Butt by Inflation</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>2020 taught the masses about <a class=\"ci ip\" href=\"https://medium.com/the-ascent/if-you-have-any-money-its-about-to-lose-a-lot-of-value-b78c6d2843f7\" rel=\"noopener\">money printing</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money printing is where governments create money out of thin air, to collect more money on top of taxes, to pay for prior or current stuff-ups (pandemics, wars). This process devalues any money you have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If all your money is tied up in assets then you might think you&rsquo;re safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge is, creating money out of thin air distorts the price of assets like real estate and stocks. This affects you in one simple way: the value of an asset becomes difficult to calculate. When you don&rsquo;t know the inherent value of an asset, you quietly have some of that value taxed away from you. Or you become delusional and say &ldquo;my stock portfolio went up 20%!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tricking you into thinking you&rsquo;re getting richer is one of the biggest lies of current society. Your psychology is predicated on you thinking you&rsquo;re getting richer so you keep using the old financial world and paying their taxes and middlemen fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bitcoin lights a fire under the idea of middlemen.<br />\r\nYou can trust a <em>man</em>, or you can trust irrevocable code.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The Ridiculously Simple Point of Bitcoin Is This</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Buy Bitcoin. Don&rsquo;t buy it. Watch the price go to $100,000 or ignore it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Winklevoss twins of Facebook fame <a class=\"ci ip\" href=\"https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/the-winklevoss-twins-are-gods-compared-to-mark-zuckerberg-673c4c25898f\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> it best: Money is the greatest social network of all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The social frameworks are changing because they have to change. A small few can&rsquo;t continue to rule the world. A few giant tech companies can&rsquo;t tell us what to think and how to feel. At some point, everyday global citizens have to take back the internet again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who cares if Bitcoin goes to $100,000? It won&rsquo;t make you happy. You won&rsquo;t feel better if you missed out on buying any.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bitcoin is an idea that challenges ownership. When ownership changes, everything changes. Be open to the inevitable change coming. That&rsquo;s the point of Bitcoin that seems to be missed.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>", "views": 94, "published": true}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Build a Modern Crypto Mining Computer in 2021", "post_pic": "CryptoMining.jpeg", "category": "Growth", "description": "And exactly how much it earns", "author": 1, "date_published": "2021-05-09T17:03:09Z", "content": "<p>Earlier this year, I wrote an article about mining Bitcoin on any PC and also shared <a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://debugger.medium.com/heres-exactly-how-i-built-my-crypto-mining-computer-3653c2c77f7e\" rel=\"noopener\">the details of a cryptocurrency mining PC</a> I built in 2018.

I decided to find out, so I enlisted the help of my friend Adam, a computer engineer at a security company. (When I asked how he wanted to be identified for this piece, he requested &ldquo;Adam the Magnificent,&rdquo; but let&rsquo;s just stick with &ldquo;Adam&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adam designed a comprehensive &ldquo;bill of materials&rdquo; for a modern, home-built cryptocurrency mining PC using only parts available through major retailers like Amazon or Newegg. I bought all the parts, built the PC, and have been testing its mining capabilities. Here&rsquo;s exactly how I did it and how you can build your own modern mining PC, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>First principles</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mining</a> refers to the mathematical process a computer performs in order to help create new cryptocurrency coins and to register transactions on the blockchain. Most cryptocurrency mining PCs use a graphics card, or GPU, to perform their mining operations. You can mine with a CPU, but it&rsquo;s not nearly as efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the bad news about building a mining PC in 2021: With crypto&rsquo;s insane price spikes, finding a GPU today can be incredibly challenging, and in the words of <em>The Verge, </em>GPU prices are &ldquo;<a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">utterly out of control</a>.&rdquo; Prospective miners now pay up to $850 for a GPU that once cost only a few hundred dollars. This guide, therefore, assumes that you&rsquo;ve either finagled a GPU through some back-alley transaction (don&rsquo;t tell <em>Debugger </em>the details) or that you already have a GPU sitting around (perhaps from an old gaming PC) and want to put it to use mining crypto. In my case, I had an NVIDIA 1070 GTX from my earlier crypto experiments, which cost me $349 in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mining PC is basically just a wrapper around the GPU, which does the actual work of mining. Your goal is therefore to build the non-GPU bits of your mining PC as cheaply as possible using the simplest components that will get the job done. The good news is that the parts required to build the basics are vastly better, cheaper, more efficient, and easier to obtain than they were even a few years ago. That makes building a basic mining PC much easier and more accessible today than it&rsquo;s ever been.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The bill of materials</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the bill of materials (BOM) that Adam the Magnificent (sorry) came up with for my basic mining PC:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079NYQQJJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gigabyte GA-A320M motherboard</a> ($45.99)</li>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084JJP2W9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rosewill SRM-01B case</a> ($19.99)</li>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0899QP84L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oloy 8GB RAM stick</a> ($37.99)</li>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LYNT256/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">SEKC 128GB M2 Solid State Drive</a> ($25.99)</li>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Raidmax-500W-XT-Power-Supply/dp/B072J8W3XT/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=raidmax+power+supply+400-xt&amp;qid=1619913110&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Raidmax 500W power supply</a> ($33.98)</li>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074B856CD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">AMD A10&ndash;9700 CPU</a> ($85.99)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"c et fd fh jq pp v xx\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/560/1*eMdnz2k-difoRpW9ioQCFA.png\" style=\"height:349px; width:560px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time that I purchased them in March 2021, the parts cost a total of $249. As I write this in May of 2021, they&rsquo;re just a bit more expensive at around $332 on Amazon. Even as prices fluctuate, though, you should be able to purchase this whole BOM &mdash; minus the GPU &mdash; for around $300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several modifications you can make to the BOM to tweak your mining PC for better performance or make it even cheaper. If you have a SATA drive sitting around, you can cannibalize it and save yourself the cost of the M2 stick. I either got a bad M2 stick or ruined mine (more on that later), so I ended up cannibalizing an old SATA drive from an unused PC anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could also skip the case. Lots of miners create their PCs as &ldquo;bench builds&rdquo; with all the components exposed. Some even build <a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.ca/etiennesavard98/diy-mining-rig-case/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">DIY cases</a> for their rigs out of wood or other materials. Skipping the case would save you around $20 on your BOM &mdash; just make sure not to touch or otherwise damage your components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also tweak the BOM to make your mining PC slightly more efficient. I had an old EVGA platinum-rated power supply from my previous mining experiments, so I ended up subbing it for the Raidmax power supply in my final build. Platinum-rated power supplies are more efficient, which means they potentially use less electrical power in order to mine crypto, which helps to keep operating costs down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can get creative with your BOM in any number of other ways, too, swapping out the basic components for cheaper (or alternatively, more powerful) versions, adding in parts you have on hand, etc. That&rsquo;s part of the fun of building a custom mining PC &mdash; you&rsquo;re creating it from the ground up, so you can take whatever direction you want. These are the parts that worked for me, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The build</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>I started out by laying all my parts out on my workbench. Touching a metal surface first to discharge static electricity, I unboxed and checked everything. I then installed the port plate for my motherboard in the Rosewill case.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"c et fd fh jq pp v xx\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3226/1*ev9s0g1mKsPi3_VBJ415fQ.jpeg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, I aligned and installed the motherboard itself. The first time, I forgot to add in the motherboard standoffs first, so the board was right against the metal case. I ended up going back and putting them in so it was properly elevated.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"c et fd fh jq pp v xx\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3226/1*rHv1y7ja2iGQT_H5i_nAJg.jpeg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I removed the AMD processor and its fan and heating from its case, ensured that it was facing the right way, and installed it in the processor socket on the motherboard, engaging two levers that locked the fan in place. I plugged the fan into the CPU fan jack on the motherboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"c et fd fh jq pp v xx\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3226/1*k4IFK05p9G_dGEHwJ7llzw.jpeg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, I snapped in the RAM stick, pressing it straight down to engage the levers which lock it in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"c et fd fh jq pp v xx\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3226/1*xSZhicE3vOQ01mb7Xvw_GQ.jpeg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I then inserted the M2 stick. M2 solid-state drives were originally designed for use in laptops. They&rsquo;re extremely compact, which means they can sit right on your motherboard yet still give you hundreds of gigabytes of storage. The M2 slot on the gigabyte motherboard was so small that I couldn&rsquo;t find it at first, so I messaged Adam for help. After we located it, I snapped the M2 stick in place and secured it with a screw.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"c et fd fh jq pp v xx\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3226/1*xKVMR08sn06yGpLj6jpItA.jpeg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I then installed the power supply and plugged it into the various power sockets on the motherboard. There&rsquo;s generally a large connector for the motherboard itself and a smaller one for the processor.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"c et fd fh jq pp v xx\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3226/1*-yjvIC70avuwIm34Qoz1IQ.jpeg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I also attached the wires for the power button on the Rosewill case to the corresponding plugs on the motherboard so the button could power the computer on. At this point, my mining PC had all its basic components, so I plugged it into a monitor and fired it up. This is always a critical point in a new PC build. Did you get your BOM right? Will it run?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my case, the PC would boot up, run for a bit, and then shut down at random. After some troubleshooting (including removing all the components from the case and running them as a bench build), I realized I had forgotten the motherboard standoffs, and the board was shorting out against the case. I added them in, and the PC booted to its BIOS and ran with no problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, I plugged a USB stick with a Windows installer into the PC&rsquo;s USB port and booted to it (you can <a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-installation-media-for-windows-99a58364-8c02-206f-aa6f-40c3b507420d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">make your own</a> or use an open-source OS like Ubuntu Linux). When I went to install Windows, the installer couldn&rsquo;t find my M2 stick, so it didn&rsquo;t have anywhere to install the OS. It&rsquo;s possible that my stick was bad or that I fried it by mistake when my motherboard kept shorting out on the case. It&rsquo;s also possible that the specific M2 stick I bought wasn&rsquo;t compatible with my motherboard&rsquo;s BIOS (keep this risk in mind if you purchase my exact BOM). Either way, it was an easy fix. I took a SATA drive from an old PC, connected it to my mining PC, and installed Windows on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once Windows was booting up and running well, I installed the drivers for the NVIDIA 1070, shut the PC down, plugged the 1070 into the PC&rsquo;s PCI slot, and connected it to my power supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"c et fd fh jq pp v xx\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3226/1*5SgfiX7pRryQwr5rSoooGA.jpeg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When I booted back up, Windows installed the GPU and it ran well. My basic mining PC was ready to go!</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Mining and profits</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>As a final step, I installed mining software. I chose to use <a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://www.nicehash.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">NiceHash</a>, which I described in detail in <a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://link.medium.com/Jl6tUOAZ2fb\" rel=\"noopener\">my original piece about mining on any PC</a>. You could also use software like <a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://wineth.net/how-to-mine-ethereum-on-windows/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">WinEth</a> to mine a currency such as Ethereum directly. I like NiceHash because it&rsquo;s a one-click mining operation and because it automatically optimizes its mining algorithms based on the hardware in your mining PC. With the software, you&rsquo;re not mining directly &mdash; you&rsquo;re selling your computer&rsquo;s mining power (called &ldquo;hashing power&rdquo;) to others, who combine it with many other computers in order to mine at scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mining with the NVIDIA 1070, my mining PC earns between $2.20 and $4.28 in gross revenue per day (prices fluctuate based on the price of various cryptocurrencies and the overall demand for hashing power). On average, it earns a bit more than $3.00 per day, or around $100 per month. That&rsquo;s gross earnings, though. To calculate my actual profits, we have to take into account the cost of electricity, which mining PCs use in droves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s good news there. My original mining PC &mdash; built with 2018 parts&mdash;used 220 watts while mining. My new one uses only 150 watts, even though it&rsquo;s built around the exact same NVIDIA 1070 GPU. That&rsquo;s a substantial difference&mdash;about a 46% reduction in power consumption for the same mining performance. That&rsquo;s likely due to the newer, more efficient components in my modern PC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using 150 watts, my mining PC consumes 3.6 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per day. Here in California, we pay a lot for power; my marginal rate is $0.32 per kWh. That means I&rsquo;m paying $1.15 per day for the electricity to run my rig. Still, mining is profitable for me; even with high electric costs, I&rsquo;m earning profits of around $1.85 per day. Since my mining PC cost $599 to build (including the cost of the GPU), I&rsquo;d earn back its cost in 323 days&mdash;less than a year. After that, any earnings from mining net of electric costs would be pure profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, there are things that could push the needle of profitability in either direction. The price of cryptocurrencies could crash, and my computer&rsquo;s hashing power could be worth substantially less. They could also continue to surge, and I could break even on my equipment much sooner. Again, I have no idea what will happen next with crypto markets nor does anyone else. The Bitcoin I mined during my first cryptocurrency experiment in 2018, though, ended up growing from around $100 to more than $1,000, so the possibility of future growth does exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you choose to duplicate my build (or create your own similar mining PC), your numbers could look very different. For example, if your electric costs were much lower or you ran your rig on excess solar power, your input costs would be much lower than mine. Where I grew up outside Philadelphia, electricity costs only <a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://www.peco.com/MyAccount/MyService/Pages/ElectricPricetoCompare.aspx\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">about $0.06 per kWh</a>. Mining there, my PC would break even in just 214 days&mdash;less than eight months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also tons of ways you could scale up my build, too. You could ditch the case and swap out the motherboard for a <a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/mining-motherboards\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">mining motherboard</a>. These dedicated boards allow for up to 10 GPS in a single PC. No serious miner would use only one GPU, and these special motherboards accommodate the much more powerful mining rigs favored by professionals. You could also use a more powerful GPU. According to NiceHash, a top-of-the-line card like the <a class=\"el lj\" href=\"https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator/nvidia-rtx-3090\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">NVIDIA RTX 3090</a> would earn as much as $13 per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, though, the biggest value you get from building a mining PC probably isn&rsquo;t monetary. I found that the best thing about building mining PCs is that I&rsquo;ve developed a much deeper understanding of how cryptocurrencies work, how they&rsquo;re created, how their prices rise and fall, and how they can be held and used.

Although the best books definitely beat mediocre courses, there&rsquo;s a few reasons why a great course can leave a lasting impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, courses tend to teach foundational topics. Most books try to be original. But much of what&rsquo;s worth knowing is <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/01/27/info-overload-fake/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">actually fairly old</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Courses tend to be more balanced. A professor teaching a basic course will try to explain most of the major viewpoints. Yet a popular book written by the same professor might be completely one-sided, as they try to make the strongest case for their views. Polemical works can be useful, but they can be misleading if you mistake a contentious issue for an open-and-shut case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also just like watching courses. Reading is good. But so are listening and watching. If you do all three, you&rsquo;ll <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/03/16/audio-kindle-paper/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">probably learn more</a> than if you just stick to text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are my picks for the best free online courses to watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>1. Justice &mdash; Michael Sandel (Harvard)</h1>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly, this course is worth watching just to witness one of the best teachers of all time. Sandel teaches moral philosophy, not always known for being the most gripping topic. Yet the lectures are compelling, as students debate real-world examples that illustrate philosophical principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What impresses me most is Sandel&rsquo;s ability to teach esoteric points through Socratic dialog with his students, using their own reactions to illustrate the philosophical principles he wants to teach. There&rsquo;s a reason this class is one of Harvard&rsquo;s most popular among incoming freshman. Now you don&rsquo;t need to attend Harvard to take it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>2. Physics &mdash; Walter Lewin (MIT)</h1>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Walter Lewin&rsquo;s physics lectures (both classical and electromagnetism) were the ones I followed during the <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">MIT Challenge</a>. They&rsquo;re some of the finest classes I&rsquo;ve ever taken online. Lewin manages to explain deep concepts about how the world works through exciting experiments. He&rsquo;s also <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xODkb-i-t2M\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">really good at drawing dotted lines</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately there was a bit of a scandal on MIT&rsquo;s open platform which resulted in MIT removing any affiliation with Lewin for the course. Thus the lectures are harder to find online than they used to be. But since nothing ever truly gets removed from the internet, I think they&rsquo;re still worth watching if you want to learn physics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>3. Learning How to Learn &mdash; Terrence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley (UCSD)</h1>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aj c id mz t u v xl\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/640/0*5ZZiwChZvn3QN0Dj.png\" style=\"height:560px; width:800px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Coursera&rsquo;s <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">most popular course</a>, this one also happens to be taught by my friend, Barbara Oakley. The course is engaging and easy to follow, using neuroscience and psychology to illustrate the principles for studying better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have to admit, when this course first came out, I was a little nervous since my income depends a lot on my own, <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"http://rapid-learner-course.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">paid learning course</a>. But, I&rsquo;ve since come to appreciate that learning better is a pretty broad subject, so there&rsquo;s always going to be more to teach (and learn). Nonetheless, I recommend this course as a useful resource!</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>4. Machine Learning &mdash; Andrew Ng (Stanford)</h1>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This course started the MOOC explosion, with Ng leaving his Stanford teaching position to launch Coursera. This course has gone through multiple iterations, first as recorded lectures from an actual Stanford class, later as a simplified MOOC and now as a <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">full-blown machine learning educational platform</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve linked to the original Stanford class, as I prefer to embed YouTube. The Coursera version is also a little unclear as to whether it is actually free, or whether there&rsquo;s a small fee. However, you may prefer <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?#enroll\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the MOOC version</a> here since it is more recent.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>5. Quantum Mechanics &mdash; Richard Feynman</h1>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Richard Feynman is my all-time intellectual hero. He does a brilliant job here of explaining quantum mechanics &mdash; without using any math. I would have thought it was impossible, but somehow Feynman manages to pull it off. (And barefoot, no less!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While I highly enjoyed Allan Adams <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ3bPUKo5zc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">MIT quantum physics class</a>, the math requirements are fairly steep. The amount of people who both have the math and physics requirements, but somehow didn&rsquo;t study quantum mechanics in their undergraduate education, might be fairly limiting so I didn&rsquo;t include it here. (That said, the first lecture of the class is math-free and very well done, so I recommend it, even if you don&rsquo;t know calculus.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>6. Medical Neuroscience &mdash; Leonard White (Duke)</h1>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aj c id mz t u v xl\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/640/0*amil4IEEE_zKPkmR.png\" style=\"height:553px; width:800px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience/home/welcome\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">This course</a> is the best one I&rsquo;ve found on neuroscience. White gives a detailed walkthough of how the brain works. He even shows actual human brain tissue on camera, along with copious diagrams and slides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course is tough, especially if you want to pass the exams. I even made flashcards for it while I was studying it to keep all the anatomy straight. That said, if you just wanted to audit the class I think you&rsquo;d still learn a lot about how the brain works.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>7. Organic Chemistry &mdash; Michael McBride (Yale)</h1>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This was a course I just finished watching recently, after a reader suggested it for my effort to <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2021/01/18/biology/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">learn more biology</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found the course really engaging, especially the first semester. While organic chemistry is often one of those feared courses for memorization and complexity, McBride manages to convey the fundamental ideas through the lens of scientific discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considerable time is spent showing how certain ideas in chemistry were discovered, starting with Lavoisier, to W&ouml;hler and Kekul&eacute;. I enjoy science classes that show how we managed to figure things out, rather than encouraging you to simply accept it as true just because the teacher told you so.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>8. Immunology &mdash; Alma Novotny (Rice)</h1>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aj c id mz t u v xl\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/640/0*ldC-GNuda2Ri4PTa.png\" style=\"height:558px; width:800px\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/immunology\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">four-part course series on the immune system</a>, I coincidentally started taking this one shortly before the coronavirus pandemic began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The immune system is much more interesting than I had realized, prior to taking this course. Just how can your body develop cells that can recognize and remove completely novel pathogens, without harming any of your own tissues? How do you defend against viruses that hijack your body&rsquo;s cells or bacteria that replicate rapidly and evolve around your defenses? Why do we get allergies or suffer from autoimmune diseases?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This course builds a great foundation for these topics. The cute illustrations of various immune cells too are also a plus, as someone who likes to communicate ideas visually can appreciate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>9. World History &mdash; John Green (Crash Course)</h1>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Beautifully animated and tightly scripted, this is a course specifically developed for a YouTube audience. I enjoyed this course immensely when it first came out, giving a good overview of many different historical events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crash Course now has <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">many courses on different topics</a>, so they&rsquo;re a great resource if you prefer this style to chalkboard or PowerPoint lectures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>10. Microeconomics &mdash; Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabbarock (MRU)</h1>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Economics is probably the subject I use most in my daily thinking. If you&rsquo;re keen on learning mental models by which to see reality, economics is a really good place to start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cowen and Tabbarock write the popular economics blog <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"http://marginalrevolution.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Marginal Revolution</a> and teach at George Mason University. Their foray into online education has produced some truly stellar video courses. Their <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://mru.org/principles-economics-microeconomics\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">micro</a> and <a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://mru.org/principles-economics-macroeconomics-0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">macro</a> courses are quite good, and they manage to convey complicated ideas about the economy without veering into too much abstraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Honorable Mentions</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>I realized, after creating this list, how many good courses I&rsquo;ve taken that couldn&rsquo;t fit. So here&rsquo;s a short list of some honorable mentions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbN57C5Zdl6j_qJA-pARJnKsmROzPnO9V\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos</a> by Steven Strogatz &mdash; The math behind the Butterfly Effect and why reality can be inherently unpredictable.</li>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6VZeWuME_A\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Systems Biology</a> by Uri Alon &mdash; Fascinating machinery of human cells, from gene regulation to why we get Type II diabetes.</li>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"ck ir\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps8jOj7diA0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Programming Paradigms</a> by Jerry Cain &mdash; One of my first-ever online courses.

As your project scales and, consequently, the number of moving pieces increases, it becomes hard to understand the flow of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need a way to manage state across our React application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To solve this problem, we will use one of the most used data architectures: Redux, a unidirectional data flow pattern that works pretty well with React way of passing props to children&#39;s Components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Redux all data flows through the dispatcher as a central hub, that registers actions and send it to this dispatcher. This results in an update to the state of the store. After the store is updated, it broadcast an event declaring that their state has changed, so the views may query the new state and update themselves.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s set up our Redux:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"cg zx\" href=\"https://redux.js.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong>React Redux</strong></a> is a predictable <em>state container</em>. It helps you store complex states to handle across your application.</li>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"cg zx\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong>Redux Thunk</strong></a> is a <em>middleware</em> that allows <em>delayed</em> and <em>async operations to Redux &mdash; which will be presented next</em>.</li>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"cg zx\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong>Reselect</strong></a><strong> </strong>is a selector library that allows Redux to store the minimal possible state and recompute the state only if its arguments change.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>First, we need a <strong>rootReducer.js </strong>file<strong> </strong>to <strong>combineReducers</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>rootR</em>educer</strong> will have <em>all combined </em><strong><em>reducers</em></strong><em> </em>from the application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, we need a <strong>store.js</strong> to<code>createStore</code>and export it, applying the <strong>redux-thunk</strong> middleware:</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>applyMiddleware</em></strong> with <strong>thunk</strong> allow async operations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, on <strong>App.jsx</strong> we import and pass the <strong>store</strong> to the root of the App inside a<code><a class=\"cg zx\" href=\"https://reactrouter.com/Route.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">&lt;Provider&gt;</a></code>, as below:</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We will create an <strong>action.js</strong> and a method to<code>getMessages</code> that will call<strong> axios</strong> to make an API request for new messages, and then, <em>dispatch</em> the fetched data:</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Our <strong>reducer.js</strong> will handle the previous <em>state</em>, modify it and return with new information:</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To retrieve the data from the store, we will need a <strong>selectors.js </strong>and create a selector for <em>messages</em>, <em>loading state,</em> and <em>error handling:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To get the list of messages, a <code>useSelector</code> hook is used from any React <strong>functional</strong> components:</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Redux is a pretty complex library that needs a lot of introduction and tutorials to get started and along with. It also has a lot of different implementations and way of setting up. Please, check the <a class=\"cg zx\" href=\"https://redux-toolkit.js.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Redux Toolkit</a> website for more information on how to implement it in your project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Navigation</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Building a web/mobile solution most of the time will lead to more than one single page, and we need to handle these routes.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"cg zx\" href=\"https://reactrouter.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong>React Router Dom</strong></a><strong> </strong>is a collection of <strong>navigational components</strong> that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have <strong>bookmarkable URLs</strong> for your web app or a composable way to navigate in <strong>React Native.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In this example, we want the message list to be the <strong>home </strong>of our application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We create a component named <strong>HomePage</strong> and return the <strong>MessageListContainer </strong>as a component of a <code><a class=\"cg zx\" href=\"https://reactrouter.com/Route.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">&lt;Route/&gt;</a></code>, as stated:</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, to insert routes on our app and <em>navigate</em> between them, we need to wrap our <strong>App.jsx</strong> with a<strong> Router </strong>and a<strong> Switch </strong>containing all application<strong> Routes. </strong>Our Switch will prevent all routes to be rendered. Instead, it will only render the first matching <code><a class=\"cg zx\" href=\"https://reactrouter.com/Route.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">&lt;Route&gt;</a></code>&mdash; in this case, the HomePage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this example, we have the<strong> HomePage </strong>and<strong> SettingPage:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose that we have a menu with a <strong>button</strong> that <em>redirects</em> the user to the <strong>SettingsPage.</strong> On a React <strong>functional </strong>component, we import the<strong> </strong><code>useHistory</code> hook and calls <strong>push</strong> to the page:</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Router is a big library that has many ways of handling the navigation alongside of pushing new pages.

Here we are using a parameter <code>t</code> to help us translate validations messages:</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, with <code>useFormik</code> hook we pass <strong>initialValues </strong>of our form, our previously defined <strong>validationSchema</strong>, and an <strong>onSubmit </strong>function that will receive our values as a parameter and <em>dispatch</em> the login action to redux:</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When all setup is done, we will pass the returned constants from <code>useFormik</code> to our <em>form</em>, <em>inputs,</em> and <em>button</em> as needed. The return of functional component will look like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h1>Testing</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Our applications need tests. Unit, integration, end to end&hellip; A lot of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"cg zx\" href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong>React Testing Library</strong></a> is a package to test your <em>React DOM</em> components functionalities without relying on implementation details. This way, you can easily test your components&#39; features without worrying too much about refactors that could break your tests and slow down your team. Using the testing library focus on the supposed output instead of how it was done.</li>\r\n\t<li><a class=\"cg zx\" href=\"https://jestjs.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><strong>Jest</strong></a> is a library to create, run, and structure tests.

Everybody knows that by now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve used flow states to write consistently for the past 7 years. Without this higher state of consciousness, I&rsquo;d be stuck back in 2014 trying to get over my fear of what other people thought about my writing. Flow states mean I simply don&rsquo;t give a damn anymore about any of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is this: getting into a flow state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People think I&rsquo;m a self-improvement junkie who has mastered <a class=\"az ej\" href=\"https://medium.com/the-ascent/3-hours-of-creative-flow-every-day-is-all-you-need-to-change-your-life-4afa8df5eec\" rel=\"noopener\">flow</a>. That&rsquo;s a lie. I am terrible at getting into a flow state. Over the last few months, it has taken me more than three hours to get into flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I start trying to write at 7 AM every Saturday and eventually don&rsquo;t get started work until 10 AM, and often as late as 11 AM. That&rsquo;s three hours that get wasted procrastinating. I procrastinate by reading other writers, watching Youtube videos, replying to emails, and posting silly status updates on LinkedIn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, I found a way to beat procrastination.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h1>The Breathtakingly Simple Way to Beat Procrastination</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>There is hope for us procrastinators. You don&rsquo;t need to keep giving your time away to the procrastination gods. This technique applies to any form of work, but I&rsquo;ll use writing as the example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One Saturday I found the answer. I sat down to write. The clock hit 8 AM. I told myself I was going to type out the outline of a draft story I would most likely not write. I wrote the title. I wrote the sub-headings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty quickly, I wrote the whole story. Right after I completed writing that story I was in a raging flow state. I felt like Mozart when he wrote his most famous symphony. The trick to beating my procrastination habit?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Write one crappy story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Translation: Lower the quality of your first piece of work for the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By having zero expectations, I beat procrastination. Thinking about starting work creates resistance. What you&rsquo;re really doing is preparing yourself to meet a standard, not start work. When your quality standards for your work are too high, you take longer to start work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low-quality work is simple to start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High-quality work feels like preparing for a two-day marathon.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h1>Use These Flow State Accelerators to Level Up</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve solved your procrastination problem, you can then accelerate your <a class=\"az ej\" href=\"https://medium.com/the-ascent/you-pay-to-see-someone-in-a-flow-state-b8fad13f7ad3\" rel=\"noopener\">flow state</a> and increase its power.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Add an event at the end of your work.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When my girlfriend books a social event at the end of a writing session it drives me nuts. I&rsquo;m literally cursing in my head. Then I realized she&rsquo;s actually doing me a flow state favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An event at the end of your work helps you rethink how much time you have. When time is scarce there is no time for procrastination. Book an event in your calendar to create motivation and the urgency to finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Turn into a dog and give yourself a treat.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Dogs love treats. So do humans. Give yourself a treat for finishing your work. Know what it is beforehand. Commit to it. Then tell yourself you can&rsquo;t have the reward until the work is done. Visualize the reward while you work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Think of flow states as energy you put out.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you put out energy into the world you get it back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I try to put <a class=\"az ej\" href=\"https://writingcooperative.com/writing-is-the-transfer-of-enormous-energy-4987d6feeb\" rel=\"noopener\">energy</a> into the world through writing. I often get emails from readers that are loaded with energy. You can feel the energy as you read their words. Recently, I realized the energy I was feeling in these emails was actually the original energy I&rsquo;d put out into the world, except it was larger and a different form of energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A flow state enables you to do your work and this work puts energy into the world. Energy moves people to take action. Energy causes life to move forward. Energy from one person, sparks energy in another person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to see this phenomenon in progress, then watch Beatles singer Paul McCartney move an entire stadium with a chant (energy) <a class=\"az ej\" href=\"https://youtu.be/tRnFHfI7WAQ?t=231\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flow states create energy that transcends you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Watch a person be possessed by a flow state.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Flow states can make a person look possessed. If you want a brilliant example of this, then watch musician Conor Maynard sing this <a class=\"az ej\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwgNpObouB0&amp;list=RDMM&amp;index=6\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">song</a>. 41 million people watched Conor in flow and many of the comments describe him looking as though he&rsquo;s &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; the song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the comments are trying to describe is the type of flow state they are watching. Conor has moved into a different dimension in his head where expectations, friction, and resistance are removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flow is beautiful to watch. I call it <em>flow state tourism.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you watch a person in flow, you have the evidence needed to work on and enhance your own flow state.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Getting into a flow state is all in your head. All you have to do is pretend you&rsquo;re not starting work. Tell yourself you&rsquo;re just messing around. Create a piece of art you expect to throw in the trash. Enjoy how low-quality the first hour of your work is going to be. Tell yourself, low-quality to start with is okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting to work is how you produce your best work. My editor said this to me last week: &ldquo;Your best writing is about 2&ndash;3 stories into your writing session.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This one sentence reinforced what I now understand. You rarely do your best work at the start. Like a runner, you have to warm-up your mind on low-quality work before the real gems start to flow out of you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beat procrastination by starting with terribly low-quality work.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>", "views": 0, "published": false}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 17, "fields": {"title": "7 Habits I Avoid to Become Very Productive", "post_pic": "productuve_3QwwTJX.jpeg", "category": "Growth", "description": "Cutting these things helped me boost my productivity.", "author": 1, "date_published": "2021-05-22T18:26:00.529Z", "content": "<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, there are a million-and-a-half things you want to do: Build your business, exercise more, spend more time with friends and family, read more books, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do you pack that into a 24-hour day that&rsquo;s already occupied with sleeping and eating?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While most people try to become more productive by adding things, I&rsquo;ve discovered it&#39;s far easier to start by subtracting what kills productivity in the first place. Because when you look at highly productive people, even though they&rsquo;re in different industries with different workflows, they always avoid key mistakes that sabotage everyone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re ready to skyrocket your productivity to get more done than ever before, avoid these 7 specific habits.

You&rsquo;re just doing more busywork more efficiently. Ultimately, the <em>best </em>measure of productivity is how much you create and ship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highly productive people deliver their work to the world. They have the courage to make things happen and they act despite their fear. While it&rsquo;s important to focus on the process, don&rsquo;t overlook the results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is it you want to achieve? Make sure your results are moving toward your goals. Once you start focusing on your output, your productivity will skyrocket.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h1>2.

Consuming useless information like social media, checking email, and responding to messages to start your day puts you in a state of <em>reaction</em>: Now, you&#39;re flooded with stressors and urgent tasks before you even have a chance to work on your <em>own</em> goals (or put on your pants).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems like an innocent peek, but since you&rsquo;re not at work, you can&rsquo;t even do anything about it yet; it&rsquo;ll just stay in your mind and prevent you from being present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, highly productive people take steps toward their goals before they let the demands of the day interfere. They focus their peak mental, emotional, and physical energy of the morning on their highest priorities&mdash;not checking Instagram or watching the news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To avoid those distractions first thing in the morning, don&rsquo;t just &ldquo;try harder.&rdquo; Leave your phone on Airplane Mode when you sleep. Set a Do Not Disturb mode so you don&rsquo;t get notifications for the first hour of your morning. Build it into your environment and you&rsquo;ll break the habit quickly.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h1>3. Allowing Distractions During Work</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s emails, messages, or calls, we switch tasks or get interrupted every <a class=\"az ej\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/23146/too-many-interruptions-work.aspx\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">3 minutes and 5 seconds</a>. Yet no matter how hard you try, if you get distracted that often, you&rsquo;ll struggle to focus because <a class=\"az ej\" href=\"https://www.livescience.com/37420-multitasking-brain-psychology.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">we are all terrible at multitasking</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, if your workspace is clutter or disorganized, it can <a class=\"az ej\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-case-for-finally-cleaning-your-desk\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">negatively affect your cognition, stress, and emotions</a>. In fact, just <a class=\"az ej\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21228167/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>seeing</em> clutter hurts your mental performance and focus</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highly productive people, however, bulletproof themselves from distractions and constant notifications so they can focus on their task at hand. They also don&rsquo;t work in a sloppy, cluttered environment, and they keep things (relatively) clean, organized, and minimalist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help, try putting your phone on airplane mode or turning off email notifications while you work so you don&rsquo;t get bombarded. Close all the tabs, browsers, and applications you don&rsquo;t need. Organize your workspace so there&rsquo;s less clutter. Don&rsquo;t listen to podcasts or radio stations while working and instead play the same song on repeat (which actually works to improve your focus).</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h1>4. Working Until Exhaustion</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>While there are times you have to work late to finish a project, it&rsquo;s not a long-term recipe for success. And if you constantly work until you&rsquo;re exhausted, those last few hours of work probably won&rsquo;t be good anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highly productive people don&rsquo;t work until there&rsquo;s nothing left in the tank: They stop long before they get to that point. Remember: Your cognitive abilities are limited&mdash;<a class=\"az ej\" href=\"https://hbr.org/podcast/2015/03/your-brains-ideal-schedule.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">we only have about three hours of peak mental performance every day</a>. Apply those golden hours to things that are important. Sure, you can still work after those three hours, but once you feel your performance dipping, it&rsquo;s a good place to stop. (After all, you need to rest and recover to be able to perform well the next day.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, take regular breaks during the day to <a class=\"az ej\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/changepower/201704/how-do-work-breaks-help-your-brain-5-surprising-answers\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">help you recover, re-energize, and refocus for better mental performance</a>&mdash;that way, you can deep work for longer.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h1>5. Working Without Priorities</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>― Dwight D. Eisenhower</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not everything on your to-do list is equally important. Highly productive people focus their energy on the most important tasks&mdash;not just the urgent ones&mdash;which allows them to get the most results from each day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you start working, try ranking your tasks in order of importance so you can dedicate your best hours of each day to what will get you the most results. And if you don&rsquo;t know your priorities, just ask.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t do everything at once and there&rsquo;s an opportunity cost to your tasks. Always think about what&rsquo;s on your plate, what are the one to three <em>biggest</em> priorities, and what can wait.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>6. &ldquo;Finding&rdquo; Time to Do Things</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a saying I&#39;ve found to be true like nothing else:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you want something done, give it to a busy person.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you give a task to someone who has all the time in the world, they&rsquo;ll struggle and procrastinate. But if you give it to someone who is extremely busy, they will make it happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highly productive people don&#39;t <em>find </em>time to do the things they want; they <em>make</em> time. If it&rsquo;s important&mdash;for example, getting regular exercise or spending time with their children&mdash;<a class=\"az ej\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ramit/status/958158284623679488?lang=en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">they&rsquo;ll set it in their schedule and make sure it gets done</a>. They know how to organize and manage their time so all their priorities in work <em>and</em> <em>life</em> get accomplished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the essential things that you often postponed? Don&rsquo;t &ldquo;find&rdquo; time&mdash;it probably won&rsquo;t get done that way. If they&rsquo;re important to you, set it in your calendar and build your schedule <em>around</em> them.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h1>7. Failing to Set Boundaries</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Bragging about working 12-hour days isn&rsquo;t a sign of productivity; it&rsquo;s a sign of poor boundaries. Many people take on all kinds of projects that, frankly, won&rsquo;t move the needle in their life. Or when people invite them to do something they don&rsquo;t want, they feel obligated, draining themselves of time and energy (and creating resentment).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But highly productive people set boundaries on their time and don&rsquo;t let lesser things take away from what&rsquo;s most important. They&rsquo;re not rude; if anything, they gain respect for showing they focus on the things, people, activities, and more that are most important to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highly productive people are also very protective of their workflow. For example, if they know their mornings are best for creative work, they&rsquo;ll schedule their phone calls for the afternoon. They understand what helps them achieve their best work and what holds them back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn how to politely say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to requests or invitations and save yourself time and aggravation. Maybe it&rsquo;s just not a priority or you don&rsquo;t want to do it&mdash;that&rsquo;s okay. Also, find the workflow that works best for you and schedule your day to fit that.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h1>Takeaways</h1>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Productivity is about how much you create and deliver; not just finishing busywork. Don&rsquo;t overfocus on minor details like having the perfect calendar. Measure your results and your work will improve.</li>\r\n\t<li>Avoid checking your phone, emails, and social media first thing in the morning, which puts you in &ldquo;reaction&rdquo; mode. Instead, take a step toward your goals before touching them.</li>\r\n\t<li>Multitasking and switching tasks ruin your productivity. Instead, minimize distractions while you work and remove clutter from your workspace.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&rsquo;t work until you&rsquo;re exhausted; you&rsquo;ll burn out and had nothing left for the next day. Instead, stop when you feel your productivity decline and take breaks throughout your day to conserve energy.</li>\r\n\t<li>Prioritize your tasks based on importance, not just urgency, so you can maximize the results you get from each workday.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&rsquo;t <em>find</em> time for the things that are important to you; <em>make </em>time. Set it in your calendar and build your schedule around it.</li>\r\n\t<li>Avoid saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to every request and overwhelming yourself with unimportant things. Set boundaries on your time and learn how to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; politely so you can say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to what really matters.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>", "views": 5, "published": true}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 1, "fields": {"post": 1, "name": "Guest 1", "email": "test@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-09T14:22:01.443Z", "content": "First Comment"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 4, "fields": {"post": 2, "name": "Commenter", "email": "commenter@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-09T19:03:05.631Z", "content": "This is comment from the page form"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 5, "fields": {"post": 2, "name": "Its ME", "email": "me@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-09T19:07:24.922Z", "content": "Yo Thats an awesome post"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 7, "fields": {"post": 3, "name": "hahah", "email": "haha@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-09T19:55:47.649Z", "content": "HAHAHA!"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 8, "fields": {"post": 3, "name": "Tester", "email": "Test@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-09T19:58:00.565Z", "content": "Test"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 9, "fields": {"post": 3, "name": "Tester2", "email": "Test2@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-09T19:59:36.777Z", "content": "Test2"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 10, "fields": {"post": 2, "name": "Phone user", "email": "nanasathya@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-10T06:25:39.516Z", "content": "Comment from phone💪"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 12, "fields": {"post": 1, "name": "AnonymousUser", "email": "AnonymousUser@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-12T21:37:23.561Z", "content": "AnonymousUser comment"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 13, "fields": {"post": 1, "name": "sathya", "email": "nanasathya@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-12T21:40:29.884Z", "content": "Signed in user comment"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 14, "fields": {"post": 2, "name": "sathya", "email": "nanasathya@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-13T13:32:58.478Z", "content": "4th comment!!!"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 15, "fields": {"post": 2, "name": "sathya", "email": "nanasathya@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-13T13:44:00.118Z", "content": "5th \n"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 16, "fields": {"post": 2, "name": "sathya", "email": "nanasathya@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-13T13:44:07.345Z", "content": "6th"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 17, "fields": {"post": 2, "name": "sathya", "email": "nanasathya@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-13T13:44:13.563Z", "content": "7th"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 25, "fields": {"post": 1, "name": "sathya", "email": "nanasathya@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-14T19:03:17.987Z", "content": "4th comment!!!"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 26, "fields": {"post": 8, "name": "Vikas", "email": "vikias@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-16T20:18:06.969Z", "content": "Follow me for more react posts"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 27, "fields": {"post": null, "name": "Tejasram B", "email": "tejasram03@gmail.com", "date_published": "2021-05-18T20:01:56.002Z", "content": "Omg ur so amazing!!!!
